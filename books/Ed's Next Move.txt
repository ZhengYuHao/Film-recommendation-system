Ed's Next Move is a 1996 American romantic comedy film written and directed by John C. Walsh. It stars Matt Ross and Callie Thorne. A micro-budget romantic comedy about a transplanted Midwesterner adapting to life in New York's East Village, the film appeared at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival where it received critical praise and was picked up by Orion Classics for theatrical release. The LA Times' Kenneth Turan called the movie "one of the most appealing, audience friendly films at Sundance,"[1] while Roger Ebert referred to the film as "a truth telling comedy with quiet wit and bright dialogue.[2] " Sight & Sound called it "a perfectly formed romantic comedy."[3]
