La Vie sexuelle des Belges 1950¨C78 is a 1994 film satire on Belgian provincialism that proved a major cinematic success in Belgium. It was the first film by now-famed Flemish provocateur and director Jan Bucquoy. It tells an autobiographical tale of a clueless young bumpkin, Jan, trying far from successfully to keep up with times failing equally at being a 1960s free-love youth or political activist and finally sinking into a mundane life.
