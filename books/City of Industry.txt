City of Industry, or simply referred to as Industry, is an industrial suburb of Los Angeles in the San Gabriel Valley region of Los Angeles County, California. Home to over 2,500 businesses and 80,000 jobs,[7] but only 219 residents according to the 2010 census (down from 777 residents in 2000), the city is almost entirely industrial. It was incorporated on June 18, 1957 to prevent surrounding cities from annexing industrial land for tax revenue.[8]
