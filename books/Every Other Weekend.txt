"Every Other Weekend" is a duet by American country music artists Reba McEntire and Kenny Chesney, recorded on the former's 2007 album Reba: Duets. The song, written by Skip Ewing and Connie Harrington, is the third and final single from the album. When shipped to radio, Chesney's vocals were replaced with Ewing's, although for most of its chart run the song was not credited to either duet partner. It peaked at number 15 on the Billboard country singles charts in 2008, and number 4 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100.
